# Moderation
The moderation policy applies only to Discord where most conversations take place. It is used to forcibly mute someone (called discourse constriction) when the need arises and restrict their participation through sending messages in channels temporarily. It is a mechanism to stop bad behavior without having to demote, remove, or expel people.

## Article I - Approval of Discourse Constriction
When a person is speaking in a way that sevreal others view as negative/over the line/personally attacking, they should feel empowered to do something about it. For the purposes of this moderation policy document, there are 2 separate tiers to approving a constriction on someone's participation:

1. If the person whose discourse needs constricted is an officer, then 3 voting members of the lower council must be in favor of constriction.
1. If the person whose discourse needs constricted is not an officer, then 2 voting members of the lower council must be in favor of constriction.

## Article II - Method of Discourse Constriction
When discourse constriction has been approved by the requisite number of voting members of the lower council, they should then determine how long to constrict discourse for.

1. Constriction (muting) may only be done for up to 24 hours per warranted mute.
2. Constriction (muting) may be done for any length of time less than 24 hours.

One of the voting lower council members then announces in the most appropriate channel (typically where the messages happened) that the user is being muted and list the duration of the mute. Reasoning does not need to be given, but can be. Users have no right to appeal, but any of the voting members who approved the constriction may remove the restriction at any time and should announce it in the same channel that the constriction was announced in.

If a user sends multiple messages that warrant muting, they may only be muted for up to 24 hours total at that time. They cannot be muted again until after the mute has taken place, is removed, and then the user warrants muting again.

## Article III - Limits
1. This policy document can be used to mute anyone in the server, regardless of membership within the April Knights organization.
2. Constriction can be levied against the grandmaster.
3. Constriction can be levied against any Upper Council or Lower Council member.

# Discourse Constriction Act
Empowers members of the April Knights to take an active role in helping moderate discussion within the organization.

### Section I - Background
When discussing items, people can sometimes get overly attached, aggressive, or personal. When that happens, they usually don't take well to being told to knock it off. Especially if the person they are engaging with is also the person telling them to knock it off. There needs to be some way to ensure that discussions don't turn into personal attacks and hurt feelings and relationships within the April Knights.

### Section II - Method
This act creates a procedure for moderation wherein members of the lower council (which are representative of the population) can band together and enforce the muting of other members.

### Section III - Enactment
This act goes into effect like other legislation when passed.

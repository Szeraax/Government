# Election Tie Breaker Act
This bill proposes changing the tie breaker method for Grandmaster elections. The law document executing this change can be found here. The purpose of this document is to highlight the reasons why the tie breaker method needs to change. If this bill passes, the law linked will be put into effect.

### Section I - Old method is untenable
1. Undiplomatic. The method of restarting the election discards all previous votes. This is a  disrespectful and inadmissible treatment of valid Knight votes. Why should valid votes be disregarded and abandoned?
1. Discouraging and confusing. It will be confusing to explain to people why they need to vote a second time. It’s highly likely some people will ignore the notifications because they know they already voted, and will not look too carefully at the announcements. And it would discourage people from voting in the future, because they now recognize that there are cases in which their vote could be essentially ignored.
1. Too much work and time. Having been through the process of running for Grandmaster, the election is an excessively arduous experience. It’s a ton of work for the person running it and the candidates. Restarting the process also cuts into the time needed for the new Grandmaster to get ready for the upcoming event.
1. Does not solve anything. What purpose does restarting the debate thread serve? The questions will either be repeated, retreading ground, or not, which would be a dead thread. The first week is more than sufficient for everyone to ask any urgent questions they have. Any new questions rendered in a tie breaker are going to be nothing but busy work and unlikely to sway anyone. In addition, restarting the vote does not actually improve the representation of democratically choosing a Grandmaster.

### Section II - New method
1. Double check the vote count. Please, before launching any additional endeavors, verify that all votes are valid and have been counted accurately.
1. Extend the voting window. Giving opportunities for more people to vote, especially informing them how crucial their vote will be, is going to encourage a higher voting turnout and investment. The Election Administrator has discretion over how long this window should be. Perhaps it makes sense to extend it through the next weekend. Or perhaps the event is approaching quickly and the window needs to be shorter. I specified at least 3 days so that the extension cannot be a “sudden death” mode in which the next person to vote decides the outcome, and it gives time for another wave of notifications to be sent out, manually if necessary. One week is the cap because we all need to move on with our lives at some point. All further tie breakers will therefore not take any additional time, beyond that of the Election Administrator being available.
1. If somehow all of that is still a tie, just let the Election Administrator pick someone.

### Section III - Revise Election Act
The Election Act will need to be revised to reflect the new method.

Version 1.0 is here, which is current at the time this bill is proposed.

Version 2.0 is here, which may be the current version at the time this bill is voted on.

The new version is here, and will replace the previous version if this bill passes.

### Section IV - Enactment
This bill will go into effect as soon as it is passed by both Councils.
